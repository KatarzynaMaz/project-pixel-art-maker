# Pixel Art Maker Project
This was a Udacity project. We ere given starter code, including HTML and CSS, to build the application and had to write JavaScript code that lets the user to create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

Users should be able to:

* Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid.
* Choose a color.
* Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
Our primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.
